            "content_html": "<p>Today's <a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/34\">Cybersecurity tip</a> is: use a VPN</p>\n<p>I've already posted about the <a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/39\">importance of encryption</a>, but that focused on your \"data at rest\"&nbsp;- your hard drives and mobile device. Today's tip is about Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) which encrypts your network traffic between your computer or mobile to the end server. You're likely already a little familiar with a form of this with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL); whenever you navigate to a website using HTTPS your traffic is encrypted between the browser and the web server.</p>\n<p>However, the benefit of a VPN is that&nbsp;<strong>all&nbsp;</strong>traffic is encrypted from your computer, not just the browser. Basically, the VPN software creates a tunnel between your computer and the VPN server and nobody else can view that traffic.&nbsp;Besides encrypting your data to keep hackers out,&nbsp;there are a couple other benefits to using a VPN.</p>\n<p>First, your data is kept private from your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and anybody else who may try to sell your data or re-route your traffic. For example, my provider Verizon sometimes redirects my traffic to their own search engine rather than my search engine of choice. While this doesn't hurt my browsing experience&nbsp;<em>in essence</em>, it's annoying that they're intercepting my traffic and trying to monetize that when I already pay them for a service.</p>\n<p>Second, you can make your computer or device appear to come from a different IP address or location. There are many reasons you might need to change your IP address or circumvent geographical network barriers, and a VPN is an easy way to do that.</p>\n<p>There are a&nbsp;<strong>lot</strong> of options when it comes to a VPN provider. There are even a lot of&nbsp;<em>free</em> VPN options available. I discourage the free services simply because they have to make their money&nbsp;<em>somewhere</em>; unless they've spelled out how they're making their money, and you're okay with it. In that case,&nbsp;it might be a good start for you. Otherwise, there are a lot of affordable services that would be much more secure.&nbsp;A few things to pay attention to&nbsp;before purchasing/choosing a VPN service:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay attention to the number of servers available to which to connect&nbsp;- more servers available means more options for you</li>\n<li>Determine if geo-shifting your location is important - some services charge more for overseas or out-of-country VPN connections</li>\n<li>Consider when and where you will use your VPN - is it's an \"always on\"&nbsp;or \"on demand\" type of connection; some services restrict bandwidth or only offer limited bandwidth to begin with</li>\n<li>Will you use the VPN on your mobile device - if so, make sure the provider offers an app for your phone or tablet</li>\n<li>Ask yourself how important privacy and plausible deniability are to you - people have their own reasons for using a VPN and all providers handle logging, jurisdiction, etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's a fantastic, comprehensive breakdown of almost 200 VPN providers available at <a href=\"https://thatoneprivacysite.net/vpn-comparison-chart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">That One Privacy Site</a>. There are many more factors reviewed on there, like the provider's activism for example. It's the most thorough review site I've seen and I highly recommend you check it out!</p>\n<p>In the end, you have to&nbsp;<strong>trust</strong> the service you're using with your data; just like you currently trust your ISP with your data (or probably more). So, a little research is worth it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See you tomorrow!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Today's <a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/34\">Cybersecurity tip</a> is:&nbsp;<strong>be careful with public wifi and hotspots</strong></p>\n<p>Of course we're all wary of public wifi, aren't we? We&nbsp;<em>never</em> just join a hotspot at a cafe because it happens to have the same name as the cafe, right?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It takes little to no effort to setup a hotspot and advertise it to people to connect. On <em>any</em> wireless network all your traffic travels through that router or wireless access point (WAP) and can potentially be stolen. I'm not saying you can't join the cafe wifi; I'm saying be&nbsp;<em>careful</em> and pay attention before you join.&nbsp;So, in the spirit of today's tip, here are a few things to keep in mind when you're joining a public, or uncontrolled, wifi or hotspot:</p>\n<p><strong>Prefer secured wifi over unsecured</strong>. If given the option of WPA or WPA2 protected network (password required), choose that over the unsecured network.</p>\n<p><strong>Validate&nbsp;the SSID.</strong> Does the network name match the advertised name? If it's not advertised, ask somebody who works there.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Turn off \"remember this network\".</strong> You probably have \"attwifi\", \"xfinitywifi\", or \"linksys\" in your list of saved networks right now (or any host of other popular names). Anybody who sets up an unsecure wifi network with the same name will grab devices automatically. Turn it off and \"forget\" those networks right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Use a VPN.</strong> Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) encrypt your traffic from the device to the server, keeping you more secure. I'm&nbsp;<em>almost</em> positive there will be another advent tip about this soon ...</p>\n<p><strong>Don't share files.</strong> Most operating systems give you the option of turning off file sharing when joining wifi. Marking the connection as \"public\" is sometimes enough, check with your operating system to be sure.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid certain websites.</strong> Don't do your banking, online shopping, or anything other internet activity that has deeply personal, private information.</p>\n<p><strong>Stay patched.</strong> I've covered this before, but make sure your devices have all the latest patches and updates to ensure you're not vulnerable to many known vulnerabilities (yes, even wifi has vulnerabilities).</p>\n<p><strong>Consider using your phone.</strong> If there's any doubt at all, most cell phone providers let you use your phone as a hotspot. If you don't have unlimited data, this can potentially push you over your limit. So pay attention!</p>\n<p>There are plenty of legitimate public hotspots out there, but it only takes one bad one to steal your data or plant a virus on your computer. Hopefully you're now more aware than you already were and will stay safe.</p>\n<p>See you tomorrow!</p>",

Also, how do you survive?&nbsp;Anyway, here are some things you can do to shore up your home wifi router:</p>\n<p><strong>Change Default Password</strong>. Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) probably preset the administrator username and password. Log in (using their instructions provided) and change the password. If you have an option to change the admin username, do that too! Many times, the default username/password are universal and can be found on the internet.</p>\n<p><strong>Enable Network Encryption</strong>. In order to keep your home network traffic secure and private, you'll want to turn on WPA or (ideally) WPA2 encryption. Each router has different instructions on how to do this.</p>\n<p><strong>Change Default SSID</strong>. Your Service Set ID (SSID) is the name of your network and might be set to the manufacturer's default name. Pick a new, unique name for your network to show that you take the time to configure your network properly.</p>\n<p><strong>Disable Broadcast SSID</strong>. Now that you know the name of your network, turn off broadcast so that people can't easily find your network without knowing the name. While this doesn't necessarily protect your network, it does hide it making it a little harder to crack.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Options</strong>. Depending on your level of comfort, consider turning on the firewall (if it's not already) and/or enabling MAC address filtering. These steps will ensure nobody can remotely connect to your router (other than your ISP) and only devices you specify will even be able to connect to the router.</p>\n<p>You've taken huge steps in securing your home network and should be able to rest relatively easy knowing you're browsing safely.</p>\n<p>See you tomorrow!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Today's <a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/34\">Cybersecurity tip</a> is:&nbsp;<strong>change your passwords</strong></p>\n<p>Ideally you've chosen and setup a <a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/41\">password manager</a>. If not, this part will not be as easy ... but still necessary. Changing your passwords&nbsp;will also be a time consuming process but&nbsp;one that should be ongoing in your life.</p>\n<p>As stated previously, the old school of thought was that you should change your password fairly frequently, like every 90 days. New wisdom says only change your password when there's been evidence of a breach of login information. I'm a little more conservative and don't see the harm in changing your passwords annually ... especially if you're using a password manager; it will do all the heavy lifting for you! I feel annually strikes a good balance and minimizes data loss in case of a breach.</p>\n<p>If you do use a&nbsp;password manager, it can generate a password with any parameters you give it. I recommend 16-20 characters (or more if the site supports it) and a mix of as many different types of characters as possible. If you have the option to&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> use dictionary or pronouncable words, I suggest you do&nbsp;that too just for an extra layer of security. Again, the point is to have ridiculously hard passwords to guess, and let your password manager remember it for you. Try to manually remember <strong>iJBblxg6@%Ur95VNj0uz</strong> for just one site and now think about&nbsp;how many sites with which you actually have an account.&nbsp;<em>Just don't forget your master password!</em></p>\n<p>If you're not using a password manager, then try to stick with memorable passphrases or even just use three random words that you'll remember. Most sites allow all ASCII characters, even spaces, so&nbsp;<strong>round blue bananas</strong> would be a valid password and easier to remember than the password generated <strong>iJBblxg6@%Ur95VNj0uz</strong>. Of course, it likely won't meet the password requirements of most sites ... so you'll have to mix it up a little and&nbsp;<em>still</em> remember it.</p>\n<p>Also important, use a different password/passphrase for every site or service with which you have an account (which is <em>very</em> easy to do with a password generator ... are you seeing a theme yet?). For example, if your credentials are stolen in a data breach at&nbsp;Uber.com, <em>hypothetically,</em>&nbsp;and you reused that&nbsp;password everywhere, then the hackers potentially have your login information for every site you visit. Use a different password everywhere (or one master password for your password generator ... okay I'll stop now)!</p>\n<p>Now you know how to make a good password; so&nbsp;get out there and do it. In my opinion, you should make a habit of changing your password every year on every site you visit. Put it in your calendar and then just try to break it up over the course of a week or so. Make the effort to visit 5-10 of your sites per day and change your account passwords. It shouldn't take more than 15 minutes to go through that many&nbsp;sites, so you won't spend more than a couple hours over the course of one week per year. That's a pretty small investment to help keep your digital data secure.</p>\n<p>See you tomorrow!</p>",

Oh, and you can't re-use any of the last 30 passwords you've ever used or use any part of a real word or any other number of ridiculous requirements.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fortunately, convential wisdom has changed. Analysis of a decade's worth of data showed that those super complex, constantly changing passwords didn't do much to help. Instead, the new guidelines recommend being more <em>user</em> friendly (hooray!). Long passwords with complexity is still important, but testing those passwords against lists of dictionary passwords and known compromised passwords. And of course, you still need unique passwords for every account you have.&nbsp;In reality, people can't remember that many unique passwords&nbsp;... even with <a href=\"https://www.passwordping.com/surprising-new-password-guidelines-nist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\"looser\" guidelines</a>. That's where password managers come in.</p>\n<p>The idea of a (good) password manager is that you only need to remember your secure&nbsp;<em>master password</em> and let the password manager handle remembering all the passwords for your various accounts. This frees up your mind to remember one&nbsp;truly secure password.</p>\n<p>There are several well-known and respected password managers out there, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. While there are a lot of options for password managers (Dashlane, LastPass, 1Password, etc.), the basic functionality of them is similar. Your passwords are stored, encrypted by your master password, either in the cloud or locally to your computer.&nbsp;I've used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lastpass.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LastPass</a>&nbsp;for the last seven years or so. LastPass&nbsp;only encrypts/decrypts my passwords locally, so there's no worry about a breach on their system. I&nbsp;haven't had any issues with performance, and the convenience of having my passwords on my computer and on my mobile device has saved me more than once. Bonus, LastPass supports <a href=\"../../../../../../../../../cybersecurity-advent-day-06\">2FA</a>.</p>\n<p>One last thought, I recommend you use a password manager&nbsp;that has a browser extension available. This allows the password manager to fill in form and password information directly on websites you visit. This makes it even more convenient to browse while still staying secure. If you have any specific questions about LastPass or setting (or choosing) your password manager, ask in the comments below.</p>\n<p>See you tomorrow!</p>",

Have at least&nbsp;<strong>3 copies&nbsp;</strong>of your data, on&nbsp;<strong>2 media</strong> types, and keep&nbsp;<strong>1 offsite</strong> copy.</p>\n<p>How you decide to do that will depend on what you are backing up and how your system is configured.&nbsp;Here's how I handle it:</p>\n<p>My important files are stored locally in My Documents on my computer hard drive then&nbsp;synced to a cloud drive automatically. Additionally, I have an external hard drive I plug in manually at least once per week and run Windows' File System backup at that time. So, I have three copies (one local, one online, and one on an external drive) on at least two types of media (hard drives and cloud drive) and one offsite (stored on the cloud provider servers). This same setup can be reproduced in Mac OS X with any cloud drive and Time Machine.</p>\n<p>As for your mobile device ... I suggest either the cloud drive or frequent, manual backups to your computer. My photos are the only thing&nbsp;on my mobile that I fear losing;&nbsp;so I have automatic backups to Google Photos enabled (iPhotos will do the same thing on iPhone ... but with limited cloud space). In general, you need to ask yourself what you wouldn't want to lose&nbsp;and go from there.</p>\n<p>I know it can feel overwhelming, espeically if you're not doing anything at the moment.&nbsp;So try signing up for a free cloud drive (OneDrive, Google Drive, iCloud, etc.) and just copy your \"documents\" folder to that drive right&nbsp;now. Or buy a 1TB USB drive (there are lots of great holiday deals, but typically can be found for under $50) and plug it into your system and copy everything over. Do that and you're already halfway to being fully backed up!</p>\n<p>This is certainly a bigger \"tip\" than can be dealt with in this one short post. So feel free to ask specific questions in the comments and maybe I can help set you on a better path.</p>\n<p>See you tomorrow!</p>",

The problem is when we don't pay attention and let them gather everything about us and our habits. While their service may be great, and their intentions innocent, if they've got that information then somebody with not-so-innocent intentions can get that information; you have no control over how well those companies protect your information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While it is easier than ever before to gather private information about people, it's also fairly easy to restrict that information (location, contacts, etc.). It might not be possible to restrict some information, depending on the device or application. In fact, restricting some information actually breaks the intended use of the application (imagine trying to use your Maps app without granting it location use ... possible, but not as intended). Therefore, it's worth taking 15 minutes or so to review your privacty settings to make sure you're comfortable with the amount of information you're sharing.</p>\n<p>Here's how to do that on the more&nbsp;popular platforms:</p>\n<p><strong>Windows 10</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open&nbsp;<strong>Settings -&gt; Privacy</strong> and there are several menus worth of information to review&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mac OS X High Sierra</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open&nbsp;<strong>Settings -&gt; Security &amp; Privacy -&gt; Privacy</strong> to review all your privacy settings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Android O</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>First you'll want to check your Google privacy settings by visiting&nbsp;<strong>Settings -&gt; Google -&gt; Personal Info &amp; Privacy</strong> or visiting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://myaccount.google.com\">https://myaccount.google.com</a>&nbsp;in a browser while signed in with your Google account</li>\n<li>Then you'll want to check&nbsp;<em>App</em>&nbsp;settings by visiting&nbsp;<strong>Settings -&gt; Apps &amp; Notifications -&gt; App permissions</strong> to review which apps have phone, camera, location, etc. permissions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>iOS 11</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open&nbsp;<strong>Settings -&gt; Privacy</strong> to review all your privacy settings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See you tomorrow!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Today's <a href=\"../../../../../../../../../cybersecurity-advent-intro\">Cybersecurity tip</a> is: <strong>use anti-virus and anti-malware</strong><br><br>Adding another layer of security is installing an anti-virus <em>AND</em> an anti-malware program on your computer <em>AND</em> your phone. Macs, Windows, iPhones, Androids &hellip; all of them&nbsp;are&nbsp;potentially vulnerable. Also, no single anti-virus program can catch everything, but something is better than nothing. Plus, there are so many free options available, it's almost sinful not to install one.<br><br>So, what's the difference between anti-virus and anti-malware? A Virus is&nbsp;a specific type of malware designed to spread (like a biological virus). Malware is the general term for anything bad that gets installed on your device (spyware, adware, viruses, trojans, etc.). You're probably asking why you would need two programs installed if anti-malware includes anti-virus capabilities. There are two reasons &hellip;<br><br>First, no single provider can catch everything. Every provider of anti-virus or anti-malware software handles scanning and detection in a different way. By having two different pieces of software installed, you're adding another layer of protection.<br><br>Second,&nbsp;anti-virus tools typically run all the time, scanning files and your computer on a regular basis. Anti-malware tools typically run on-demand, when you want to check something specific. <br><br>So, do yourself a favor and find a decent anti-virus and anti-malware program. I currently use <a href=\"https://www.avg.com/en-us/free-antivirus-download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AVG </a>for Anti-virus (for Windows and Android) and <a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/\">Malwarebytes </a>for anti-malware. There are plenty of both anti-virus and anti-malware options available though.</p>\n<p>See you tomorrow!</p>",
