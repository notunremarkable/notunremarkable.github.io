While we hear all the time about zero-day vulnerabilities, most exploits happen because of known vulnerabilities that have been in the wild for a while. Having the latest updates and patches will protect against the known exploits. Having automated updates enabled will help protect against zero-day vulnerabilities because you'll be updated as soon as your provider has a fix!<br><br>Fortunately, most device makers have made this process almost mindless. Your take-away today should be to check your computer and/or phone to make sure you're up-to-date AND you have automated updates enabled.<br><br>Here's how to do that on some of the more popular platforms:<br><br><strong>Windows 10</strong><br>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Operating system&nbsp;</em>updates are done through <strong style=\"font-size: inherit;\">Settings -&gt; Update &amp; Security</strong><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\"> and just verify your settings (active hours, restart options, etc)</span></li>\n<li><em>Apps downloaded through the Microsoft Store</em> are done through <strong>Microsoft Store -&gt; Settings</strong> and make sure \"Update apps automatically\" is turned on</li>\n<li><em>Apps downloaded manually</em> will need to be updated through the settings in those apps</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mac OS X High Sierra</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Both <em>Operating System</em> and <em>app</em> updates are done through <strong>System Preferences -&gt; App Store</strong> and make sure \"Automatically check for updates\" (with appropriate preferences) is checked</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Android O</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Operating System&nbsp;</em>automatic updates are enabled by default, but you can verify by going to <strong>System -&gt; System update</strong> to see the last date and time the phone checked</li>\n<li>To make sure your <em>apps</em> are updated, visit&nbsp;<strong>Play Store -&gt; Settings -&gt; Auto-update apps</strong> and select the appropriate choice (wifi only or at any time)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>iOS 11</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Operating System</em> updates are in <strong>Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Software Update</strong>; these are automatically enabled, but you can verify here</li>\n<li><em>App</em> updates are enabled in <strong>Settings -&gt; iTunes &amp; App Stores</strong> and toggle \"Updates\" to on</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See you tomorrow!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Starting on Friday, December 1, I'm going to post a series of security tips to help people learn to keep themselves safe on their computers, on their phones, and online.<br><br>While I'm using the \"advent\" aspect of a child's advent calendar, these aren't religious-based or meant to imply anything other than the use of a cute ploy to capture your interest and attention. <br><br>Security is no joke though and requires you to be active in the process. One doesn't leave their front door or car door unlocked and hope everything will be fine; they actively lock their doors when they leave because they know that helps keep their belongings protected. Security relies on making it more difficult for our adversaries to compromise our systems; and each thing we do adds to the complexity it takes to get into our systems or get our information. Remember that there is <strong>always</strong>&nbsp;a way to gain access, but we have to make them not want to gain access. There&nbsp;is no single solution&nbsp;to online and computer security.&nbsp;<br><br>Finally, these tips aren't anything new, they're available all over the place. My aim is to consolidate a lot of these tips and guidelines into one place, make them easy to digest, and help people learn how to be safe. I don't expect everybody to do everything. If one walks away just doing one or two new things to keep safe, then that helps.<br><br>Anyway, I hope everybody joins me for the next couple weeks and learns a thing or two along the way!<br><br>Note: I'll update this post with links to the full series along the way.</p>\n<p>The calendar:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/35\">Day 01</a></li>\n</ul>",

            "content_html": "<p>I have been reading about the comeback of static blog sites. During the course of my research, I thought it might be more inline with the way I like to blog and do things. My current content management system (CMS) is Wordpress. It has a lot of features, thousands of plugins to extend functionality, and even more themes (paid and free). There is a thriving Wordpress community, so it's very easy to get up and running ... literally click a button to install in some instances.</p>\n<p>At any rate, it's practical but not *fun* for me. I'm a tinkerer and like to know how things work. I've also been working with straight HTML for hundreds of years ... well, that's how it feels sometimes; so there's a familiarity and comfort level I like.</p>\n<p>So a static site generator (SSG) basically is a framework that helps you create a whole site of static pages. It will build the \"home page\" with the list of posts, track tags, authors, etc. It's usually easier to theme as well. I tried using Pelican, a Python based framework; but had some issues in Windows. For the sake of time, I started searching for other options rather than troubleshoot more (which I may still go back and do eventually).</p>\n<p>Enter <a href=\"https://getpublii.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Publii</a>. It's a downloadable tool with a GUI that helps you manage your whole site (or sites). I've connected it to Github pages to host for free and am now testing it out. So let's see how this goes! In all honesty, I was hoping for a Markdown editor, just because I like that sort of thing, but this is very nice and easy so far ... we'll see.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Back in 2015 I tried a \"<a href=\"http://2015-365.notunremarkable.me/archive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Project 365</a>\" in which I would post a picture each day. I didn't really have a theme, per se. Some days I posted something I'd done that day, other days it was completely random. My goal was just to post a picture every day so I'd have something to look back on. Guess what? I haven't really touched it since then.</p>\n<p>Last year, on my 44<span style=\"vertical-align: super;\">th</span> birthday, for some reason I decided to try it again. But this time I upped the stakes and decided to post <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">four</span> pictures each day (hence the <em>4in44</em> tag &hellip; get it now?). A Project 365 can be a time consuming and difficult task sometimes; which is apparent when you look at some of my posts in which I clearly struggled to find things to photograph. But it is an interesting and fun thing to do and I recommend people try it sometime!</p>\n<p>At any rate, this post isn't meant to dwell on the merits (or demerits) of a <a href=\"https://petapixel.com/2016/12/23/365-photo-project-without-failing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Project 365</a>. Instead, I wanted to focus on how <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><em>I</em></span> did it. Hopefully you'll see that once you've got everything setup, all you really need to do is take the pictures.</p>\n<p>Things you'll need:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Camera or phone with a decent camera - I used an LG G4, iPhone 5, and finally my Pixel XL (we switched carriers last year and my phone was on backorder)</li>\n<li>A place to post the pictures - I used Instagram and Tumblr</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><strong>Instagram</strong></span><br> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instagram</a> allows you to post single and multiple pictures per post. They also have several apps you can install separately which extend the Instagram functionality. I used their \"<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.layout&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Layout</a>\" app which lets you post a single picture collage with up to nine pictures in one collage. For my Project 365, I opted for four photos per day.</p>\n<p>Regardless of which option you choose, I recommend you pick a tag that is unique and will allow you to easily find all your photos in the Instagram app. Plus, it's catchy and sets your pictures apart &hellip; a little.</p>\n<p>You could certainly stop there. In fact, that's one of the easiest ways to participate in Project 365. I took it one step further so that I would easily be able to look back at my \"year\". Plus, Instagram made it super easy &hellip; just one more tap each day &hellip; to post my picture collage to my Tumblr site. You'll have to link your Instagram and Tumblr accounts, but let's get you setup on Tumblr first.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><strong>Tumblr</strong></span><br> If you already have a <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tumblr</a> account that you use regularly, I recommend you setup a new Tumblr account specifically for this project. Instagram will only post to your <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">main</span> Tumblr blog. Tumblr lets you setup multiple blogs, but (as of this post) there is no way to select which Tumblr blog to which you post. So &hellip; a new account is best and easiest IF you want to keep your Project 365 separate from your main blog.</p>\n<p>Once you've got your account setup, you'll jump back to Instagram and connect your account. If you setup Tumblr with multi-factor authentication (which I <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">ALWAYS</span> recommend you do whenever you can), you'll need to generate an \"application password\" in Tumblr. This is a one-time password that will only work to setup this connection.</p>\n<p>Here are the steps on Android to connect Tumblr to Instagram (it may differ on other platforms):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit your profile and hit the menu icon (vertical ellipsis)<br> <img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-140\" src=\"http://git.notunremarkable.me/media/posts/33/instagram-01-169x300.png\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\"></li>\n<li>Then tap \"linked accounts\"<br> <img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-141\" src=\"http://git.notunremarkable.me/media/posts/33/instagram-02-169x300.png\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\"></li>\n<li>Then tap \"Tumblr\"<br> <img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-142\" src=\"http://git.notunremarkable.me/media/posts/33/instagram-03-169x300.png\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\"></li>\n<li>Next, enter your Tumblr credentials; remember to use the \"application password\" you create in Tumblr for multi-factor authentication<br> <img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-143\" src=\"http://git.notunremarkable.me/media/posts/33/instagram-04-169x300.png\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\"><br> <em>Note: I also recommend you UNCHECK \"follow blog.instagram.com\" unless you really want to follow them on Tumblr</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>That's it, now you've connected Instagram to Tumblr. The next time you post a photo in Instagram, make sure you select to also post to Tumblr:<br> <img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-144\" src=\"http://git.notunremarkable.me/media/posts/33/instagram-05-169x300.png\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\"></p>\n<p>And then you'll see your photo on your Tumblr blog!<br> <img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-145\" src=\"http://git.notunremarkable.me/media/posts/33/tumblr-success-final-300x230.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"230\"></p>\n<p>So, if you decide to use this route or not ... I would love to see your Project 365. Please share your links below!

            "content_html": "<p>Baked apples are a Fall tradition in our house. Every year since the kids were little we've gone apple picking. When you've got bags and bags of apples, you have to figure out a way to use them all. Apple pies are delicious, but a little labor intensive. I don't remember how we first started making these ... but once we did, it's become a regular \"must have\" in our house.</p>\n<p>Without further ado, here's how we make baked apples ...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4 apples - good for baking (Honeycrisp, Golden Delicious, etc.)</li>\n<li>2 C flour</li>\n<li>1 tsp baking powder</li>\n<li>1/2 tsp salt</li>\n<li>2/3 C. oil</li>\n<li>1/3 C. boiling water</li>\n<li>brown sugar</li>\n<li>butter</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Preheat the oven to 375&deg;. Core and peel the apples.</p>\n<p>To make the dough, mix the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl or mixing bowl. Mix the oil and boiling water together and stir briskly until well blended. Then pour the liquid into the flour mixture and mix until all blended together. You should have a nice ball of pie crust.</p>\n<p>Split the crust into four equal parts (one part for each apple). Wrap the bottom and sides of each apple, leaving the top open for now. Make sure you reserve a small portion of dough to cover the tops later (see photo below). Place the apples into a baking dish (I use a glass 8x8 dish). Pour brown sugar in each core to the top, then pack it down. Put a dab of butter on top of the packed brown sugar, then fill the top with more packed brown sugar. Use the reserved bit of dough to cover the tops of the apples.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://notunremarkable.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/IMG_20170913_170401.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-117\" src=\"http://git.notunremarkable.me/media/posts/27/IMG_20170913_170401-169x300.jpg\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\"></a></p>\n<p>Bake for 30-45 minutes, but it really depends on the apples and how baked you want them. We like them pretty well baked and not very firm, so it takes longer. Use a fork to determine when they're done to your liking. We serve in a bowl with ice cream or vanilla flavored coffee creamer (particularly if you don't have ice cream in the house) poured over the top. Scrumptious!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://notunremarkable.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/IMG_20170913_202310.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-118\" src=\"http://git.notunremarkable.me/media/posts/27/IMG_20170913_202310-300x169.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\"></a></p>",
