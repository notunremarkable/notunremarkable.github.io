There are a multitude of services available, ranging in price. Be aware of what the services offer before you divulge your personal information and/or pay them. </p>\n<p>What to compare in credit monitoring services:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Price</li>\n<li>Which of the three services they monitor - ideally all three</li>\n<li>How often is your credit report and/or credit score updated</li>\n<li>What additional services do they offer - ID verification, dark web watch, etc</li>\n<li>Compare customer service options - 24hr phone, email, etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It also doesn't hurt to search for the company in your favorite search engine and see what comes up as far as ratings, reputation, and complaints. No service is perfect, but every layer helps. </p>\n<p>Another thing to consider is that many services you already use might offer a level of free (or included) credit monitoring. Services like AAA, your insurance company, or your bank or other financial institutions. It's worth checking their website to see what they offer.</p>\n<p>If you're up to a challenge or just like to be more hands-on, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-monitor-your-own-credit-for-free-forever-1510277742\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lifehacker wrote this post</a> a few years ago which will show you how to monitor your own credit for free!

That is to say, except completely staying off the internet and not using anybody with online connectivity ... but that's so user-prohibitive that it's not very feasible. At any rate, you <em>will</em> have some issue or problem or questionable link or whatever. You just will.</p>\n<p>So, what should you do? First step is to report it! To whom? That depends on what it is. You'll need to report some issues to the government (FTC, IRS, etc.), some to your ISP, some to the originating service. I've compiled a few places to report scams, fraud, or other issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>FTC complaint site</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/#crnt&amp;panel1-1\">https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/#crnt&amp;panel1-1</a><br>A good first stop for reporting identity theft, scams, telemarketing, spam, and a variety of other issues</li>\n<li><strong>IdentityTheft.gov</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.identitytheft.gov/\">https://www.identitytheft.gov/</a><br>Also an FTC website, but strictly devoted to Identity Theft and Data Breaches</li>\n<li><strong>FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov\">https://www.ic3.gov</a><br>To file complaints about internet-based fraud</li>\n<li><strong>e-consumer.gov</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.econsumer.gov/en/Home/FileAComplaint/1#crnt\">https://www.econsumer.gov/en/Home/FileAComplaint/1#crnt</a><br>For complaints about international e-business fraud and scams</li>\n<li><strong>StopFraud.gov</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.stopfraud.gov/sf/report-financial-fraud\">https://www.stopfraud.gov/sf/report-financial-fraud</a><br>For complaints about financial fraud</li>\n<li>A multitude of other resources is available at USA.gov - <a href=\"https://www.usa.gov/stop-scams-frauds\">https://www.usa.gov/stop-scams-frauds</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may need to visit a service's website to find where to send problems/scams/spam/etc. If you're not sure, try entering \"<strong>report fraud </strong><em>[service]</em>\" into your favorite search engine. For example, \"report fraud verizon\" returns the <a href=\"https://www.verizonwireless.com/fraud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Verizon Fraud Prevention</a> site as the first result.</p>\n<p>Hopefully you never have to use these resources, but they're good to know just in case.</p>\n<p>See you tomorrow!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Today's <a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/34\">Cybersecurity tip</a> is:&nbsp;<strong>manage your privacy while browsing</strong></p>\n<p>I'm sure it comes as no surprise that your browsing habits are tracked regularly by multiple sites. If you look at your cookies in your browser of choice right now, there are probably hundreds to thousands of cookies stored there. Those cookies feed information back to their host about sites you've visited or preferences you've set for a specific site.&nbsp;Cookies aren't inherently bad; but there are some sites that use cookies beyond their original intent or outright maliciously.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some might be inclined to just turn off cookies in their browser. However, then you risk losing some of the benefits of cookies. A reasonable alternative is to use one of several browser plugins to help protect your privacy. My plugin of choice is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ghostery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ghostery</a>.</p>\n<p>Ghostery is an easy-to-install browser plugin available for all the major browsers. Once installed, you will be walked through the setup. You will be asked a few questions in which you should consider your browsing habits and preferences about trackers. One of the last steps is to create an account in order to sync your settings across computers and browsers ... I've never done this if I'm honest; I just set it up again since it's so easy. But you do what is best for you.</p>\n<p>Once you're setup, you'll have a little icon in your browser that will show you how many trackers and cookies are being blocked on a site. If you find a site isn't working for some reason, they may have a cookie that is required for proper use. In that case, you can click on the ghost icon and&nbsp;<strong>pause</strong> Ghostery; reload the page and verify if it's working or not. If that's the case, then you can add that site as a \"trusted site\" and then resume Ghostery protection.</p>\n<p>That's really all there is to it. Now your browsing habits, sites you've visited, and any other online activities will be kept more private by having those trackers blocked. As I mentioned previously, Ghostery&nbsp;<em>is</em> a proprietary company, so they are likely anonymizing your data and monetizing it somehow. I'm okay with it because I receive a service from them for free&nbsp;<em>and</em> they're up front in their privacy policies how they use your information. If you're not alright with it, I recommend you find an <a href=\"https://prism-break.org/en/subcategories/windows-web-browser-addons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">open source alternative</a> that has similar features.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See you tomorrow!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Today's <a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/34\">Cybersecurity tip</a> is:&nbsp;<strong>use ad-blockers</strong></p>\n<p>First and foremost, I use a lot of free services on the internet. And I know many of those services rely on advertising revenue to remain in business. However, as somebody who assesses risk for a living, I look at the pros and cons of just about everything.</p>\n<p>Many websites use third-party advertising engines to feed relevant advertisements to their site (relevant to the user based on many factors). These third-party advertising engines/sites may or may not vette the advertisements and many will sell your information to advertisers. Some&nbsp;of the third-party advertising sites host malware-injected advertising as well. In my opinion, there are enough risky advertisements out there to warrant using an ad-blocker in my daily use.</p>\n<p>That said, I also do whitelist sites I trust and/or rely on in order to allow them to continue their business. There are many different options for blocking advertisements during your internet browsing ... let's take a look at a few of them:</p>\n<p><strong>Browser plugin<br></strong>There are a lot of options for browser plugins, almost too many. The two I've used regularly with good success are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">uBlock Origin</a> and <a href=\"https://adblockplus.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adblock Plus</a>. Adblock Plus does allow some pre-vetted (and \"non-intrusive\" according to them) advertising through ... which is why I switched to uBlock Origin (UO); that and UO is open source. Either way, they are both available on just about every browser out there and very configurable.</p>\n<p><strong>Browser</strong><br>There are even a few browsers with adblocking built right into their code. <a href=\"https://brave.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brave Browser</a> and <a href=\"https://www.opera.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Opera </a>are two big ones. Firefox Focus and Opera are both mobile browsers with built-in adblocking for browsing safely on-the-go.</p>\n<p><strong>Other</strong><br>You should also consider a privacy plugin like <a href=\"https://www.ghostery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ghostery</a>. This helps protect your personal information and does some ad blocking as well. I'm&nbsp;<em>almost certain</em> there will be a tip on this soon.</p>\n<p>Adblocking not only has privacy and security benefits to browsing, but can also help your user experience on many sites (faster loading, for instance). Fortunately, there are a lot of tools available that make it easy to accomplish. We looked at just a few, so I hope you're installing one now if you didn't have one already.</p>\n<p>See you tomorrow!</p>",

While this is convenient, depending on what you agreed to when you connected the account, they may be seeing more information or have more access than you intend. Not only that, but these connections are sometimes set to not expire, so you give some other company access to your information long after you've stopped using their service.</p>\n<p>Fortunately there's a relatively easy fix. Spend a few minutes today reviewing your connected accounts and ensure only the services you want connected stay that way. Here's how to check your connected apps in the big three:</p>\n<p><strong>Google</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit your <a href=\"https://myaccount.google.com/permissions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">account permissions page</a> and sign in with your Google account</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Facebook</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log into Facebook and go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings -&gt; Apps</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Twitter</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log into Twitter and go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings and privacy -&gt; Apps</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>See how easy they make it? All three tell you what level of access the connected app has and when it last connected. You might be surprised how many connections you have. When I first started doing this years ago, I had apparently connected an app I only ever used once and granted it full permission to my Twitter account (back before Twitter was better about limiting access of third party services); and it had had those permissions for almost a year. Oof.</p>\n<p>Short and sweet today, but you will definitely feel better knowing you've cleared house of some backdoor access to your social media and private information.</p>\n<p>See you tomorrow!</p>",

In general though, the more information the&nbsp;<em>bad guys</em> have about you, the easier it is to exploit that information. So, here are a few tips to keep your information private:</p>\n<p><strong>Make sure your social networks are private</strong><br>Unless you need to maintain a public social media presence (actors, politicians, etc.), then your best security is making your activity on the network&nbsp;<strong>private</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>secret</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Keep your profile information limited</strong><br>Even if you&nbsp;<em>do</em> need to maintain a public social media presence, you should limit the amount of information you share in your profile. The less you post, but better.</p>\n<p><strong>Verify your friends</strong><br>It's easy to follow anybody who follows you first.&nbsp;But making sure you're only friending people you&nbsp;<em>actually</em> know provides another layer of security when sharing potentially personal information becuase you more likely trust somebody you actually know.</p>\n<p><strong>Validate your sharing settings</strong><br>Take a look in your application's settings to see what features they offer to limit who sees your information and how it gets shared. For instance, on Facebook you can limit how people even find you or whether they need to know your email address or phone number before finding you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Think about what you're sharing</strong><br>Take a few seconds to re-read and/or think about the information you're sharing. Is it something you wouldn't mind everybody in the world knowing? If so, maybe you should modify what you post.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are about a hundred more ways you can keep your information private. But what it all boils down to is common sense. You've certainly read somebody else's social media post and thought&nbsp;<em>I wouldn't have shared that much information</em>. Hopefully you will take a few minutes to check your sharing settings and feel safe about what you're putting out there to the world.</p>\n<p>See you tomorrow!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Today's <a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/34\">Cybersecurity tip</a> is:&nbsp;<strong>be careful in email</strong></p>\n<p>In reality, you should be careful and pay attention to all the information you post or share, links you click, or attachments you open online; not just in emails. But most people use email everyday for both personal and business reasons as well as communicating with people you don't know. Most other digital communication is in a controlled environment or with a limited audience. Additionally, it's very easy for <em>\"bad guys\"</em> to exploit email because of the relative anonimity, it's easy to reach wide audiences, and easy to&nbsp;spoof. Therefore, it's very important to protect yourself and be vigilant when using email.</p>\n<p>Here are a few things to pay attention to and some guidelines to follow for your inbox:</p>\n<p><strong>Don't trust&nbsp;links</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you trust or know the person/service that sent the link?</li>\n<li>Were you expecting a link? For instance if you started a password reset for an account and need to verify your email address</li>\n<li>Check to make sure the link text matches the actual URL (mouseover or right-click to see the actual link URL)</li>\n<li>Make sure it's a secure link - HTTPS</li>\n<li>Make sure it's a trusted domain or from a service you actually have an account with</li>\n<li>Double-check the full URL - mybank.com is not the same as mybank.adifferentserver.com</li>\n<li>When in doubt, always open a browser and go directly to that service's website rather than click the link; if you receive an email from your bank stating you urgently need to open the link, then the same message should be in your account on their website&nbsp;... <strong>ALL</strong> good services do this</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Don't trust attachments</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you trust or know the person/service that sent the attachment?</li>\n<li>If your web client doesn't scan attachments for malware automatically, either save the file locally and scan or scan directly in the web client before opening</li>\n<li>Ensure the program you use to open the attachment opens it in \"safe\" mode - Adobe Reader and all Microsoft Office programs can be configured to disable running scripts or other malware processes, for example</li>\n<li>When in doubt, reach out to the person who sent the attachment and ask if it's safe - preferably contact them on a different channel (call/text), or</li>\n<li>Better yet, just delete the email</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Be vigilant of information you give out<br></strong>Even if an email doesn't include an attachment or link, the person sending it might be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">phishing</a> for information. Don't give out any usernames, birth dates, SSNs, or other sensitive information. Pay attention to who they are and what they're asking. If you wouldn't give information to a stranger face-to-face, then you shouldn't through email. And remember that it's very easy to spoof email information, so it can look like it's coming from somebody legitimate. Sometimes it doesn't hurt to verify you're having an actual conversation with the right person ... or better yet, is email the best place for that conversation? Maybe a phone call, text, or some other form of communication would be better.</p>\n<p>Hopefully these tips will help you feel a little safer using your inbox and can avoid malware or security breaches of sensitive information through email (and other digital communication).</p>\n<p>See you tomorrow!</p>",
